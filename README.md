**PERSONAL PROFILE**

A hardworking and dedicated individual, that is computer literate with an outstanding analytical record, and committed to completing any given task to the best of my ability. I have a proven track record of improving processes, lowering cost, meeting sales targets and working as a part of a team, often in a leading role, to achieve common goals. I am a very competitive person and aspire to be the best at what I do in every aspect of my life, both individually and as part of a team.

I currently work as a Purchasing and Logistics Manager for an aftermarket TPMS and OE valve hardware manufacturer in the automotive industry, where I have helped build the company in its initial months to a multi-national company with a large customer base. This job has helped extend my interest in vehicles of all natures, and the technical side of automotive products. My duties include analysis of all pricing and logistical processes, product development, performing and documenting the testing of new products, creating and maintaining a pricing and product data base, procurement of all products, visiting and receiving customers and suppliers, attending and visiting exhibitions, and management of both the warehouse and its personnel as well as general admin tasks. I originally started this job in an Administration capacity as part of a 2-person team, since then the company has grown into a multi-national organisation with over 30 employees of which I am now part of the management team after holding the role of Pricing Analyst for several years.

During 2014 I took a six-month sabbatical to travel around Australia by myself. I worked in a bar in Brisbane for three months before exploring the rest of Australia, visiting the major cities and landmarks. This gave me a great perspective on the world and a lot of time to discover where I wanted to take my life both personally and professionally.

**EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS**

**2005-2008            A-Levels**

John Cleveland College, Hinckley, Leicestershire

Psychology (B), Maths (C), and Physics (B).


**KEYSKILLS**

**Computing**

During my current role I have taught myself to have a very strong understanding of Microsoft **Excel**, I also have a good level of general computer literacy, gained through day to day use and University I.T. modules. This has given me experience and confidence in the following software packages: Minitab, LabVIEW, DevC++, MS Publisher, MS Outlook, MS Paint, MS Word and MS PowerPoint. My current role involves using **Excel** to an advanced level, **SQL** and **Sage** 50 Accounts Professional to a high standard.

**Teamwork**

I enjoy working in a team as well as individually. As part of my work with Hamaton Ltd I am part of a small and focused team that involved holding, and participating in product, pricing and sales meetings. As well as attending exhibitions as an exhibitor for a week at a time in a foreign country, this experience depending upon working as a strong team with my colleagues to promote the business.

During my employment at Flutters Bingo, my job involved working closely with and managing up to 20 employees and required me to work efficiently on my own for several hours at a time. Furthermore, in this role I as Assistant Manager I was responsible for motivating the team and ensuring other members of staff knew their roles and what was expected of them.

The practical based aspects of my university course involve working closely with other students to plan and conduct experiments.

In my spare time I am an avid hockey player, I have been part of a hockey club since I was 10 years of age and have been an active hockey player for most of that period as well as time spent in senior roles within those clubs. This has given me vast experience of running and being part of a close-knit team in my free time as well as professionally.

**Communication**

At Hamaton Ltd. my role involves constant communication with my colleagues and customers in order to successfully expand the business in a growing market, this involved orchestrating the development and distribution of several products both in a personal and online capacity. I also communicate with customers, over email, over the phone or in person, on either customer visits or at exhibitions. My work at Flutters bingo involved a lot of contact with the general public, often several thousand at a time, as well as several other members of staff. My university work involved a lot of communication, both written and verbal with other students and with teaching staff. Thus, I am not daunted by the prospect of presenting to people in a more senior role nor to large numbers.

**Time Management and Organisation**

I have an excellent track record of meeting multiple deadlines for product development and pricing exercises.

Maintaining part-time employment as well as extra-curricular interests throughout my College and University education helped me to develop my time management and financial

management skills. The ability to meet deadlines is an important part of my life, both professionally and socially.

I like to spend a lot of my spare time working on my cars as well as attending car shows across the country. I am always looking to expand my knowledge on any car related subject and experience as much as possible within the automotive world. I am a keen Formula 1 fan and have attended several races across the globe, and plan to attend many more.

Alongside my other interests I try to spend as much time as possible with my friends and family, I regularly enjoy activities including but not limited to; hiking, visiting museums, playing and watching football, watching rugby, and taking trips abroad. I am also a qualified tyre technician and a qualified first aider.
