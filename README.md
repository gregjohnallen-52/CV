**PERSONAL PROFILE**

A hardworking and dedicated individual, computer literate with an outstanding analytical record, and committed to completing any given task to the best of my ability. I have a proven track record of improving processes, lowering costs, meeting sales targets, and working as part of a team, often in a leading role, to achieve common goals. I am very competitive and aspire to be the best at what I do in every aspect of my life, both individually and as part of a team. I currently work as a Pricing Analyst for a European automation parts and solutions distributor. This role involves managing, analysing, and presenting large datasets to stakeholders at all levels of the business. I am also studying towards a Data Scientist Integrated Degree Apprenticeship with BPP University, where I am learning to use Python and other data engineering, visualisation, and analytics tools such as SQL, Power BI, and various machine learning libraries. During 2014, I took a six-month sabbatical to travel around Australia by myself. I worked in a bar in Brisbane for three months before exploring the rest of Australia, visiting the major cities and landmarks. This gave me a great perspective on the world and a lot of time to discover where I wanted to take my life both personally and professionally.

**KEYSKILLS**

**Computing**

I have a good level of general computer literacy, gained through experience in the workplace. This has given me experience and confidence in the following software packages: MS Excel, MS Power BI, MS Access, MS Outlook, MS Paint, MS Word, Sage 50 accounts, and MS PowerPoint. My current role involves using Power BI, Excel, and Access to an advanced level, SQL to a professional level, and I am currently developing my Python skills for use in a data science environment.

**Teamwork**

I enjoy working in a team as well as individually. In my current role at Routeco Ltd, I collaborate closely with various departments to analyse and present large datasets. This involves participating in cross-functional meetings and working with stakeholders at all levels to ensure data-driven decision-making. My experience at Routeco has strengthened my ability to work as part of a cohesive team to achieve common goals. Additionally, my previous roles have provided me with extensive experience in team dynamics and leadership, which I continue to apply in my current position.

**Communication**

At Routeco Ltd, my role involves constant communication with colleagues and stakeholders to present data insights and support business strategies. I regularly prepare and deliver presentations to senior management, ensuring that complex data is communicated clearly and effectively. My work requires me to liaise with various departments, providing data-driven recommendations and collaborating on projects. This experience has honed my ability to communicate technical information to non-technical audiences, both in written and verbal forms.

**Time Management and Organisation**

I have an excellent track record of meeting multiple deadlines for product development and pricing exercises. Maintaining part-time employment as well as extra-curricular interests throughout my college and university education helped me to develop my time management and financial management skills. The ability to meet deadlines is an important part of my life, both professionally and socially..

**INTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES**

**Hockey**

I played hockey from when I was 8 until very recently, playing as a goalkeeper since 10, and gained a very strong interest in all aspects of the game including umpiring and coaching. I have played for several clubs: Nottingham Trent University H.C., West Bridgford H.C., Rottweilers of lurve M.H.C., Leicestershire u21s, Nomads M.H.C. as well as Leicestershire’s full county squad. I was previously captain of the A side for Nomads M.H.C. as well as holding roles of vice-captain, team coach, club secretary at various points throughout my tenure. I have recently retired from my second spell with West Bridgford H.C. where I competed at Midlands level and was a part of the Captaincy team.

**Automotive**

I am a self-confessed “Petrol Head” and have a keen interest in vehicles and motorsport of all shapes and sizes. I like to spend a lot of my spare time working on my cars as well as attending car shows across the country. I am always looking to expand my knowledge on any car related subject and experience as much as possible within the automotive world. I am a keen Formula 1 fan and have attended several races across the globe, and plan to attend many more.

**Other**

Alongside my other interests I try to spend as much time as possible with my friends and family, I regularly enjoy activities including but not limited to; hiking, visiting museums, playing and watching football, watching rugby, and taking trips abroad. I am also a qualified tyre technician and a qualified first aider.
